# Abstract
In this study, we argue that the presence of third party quality revelation mechanisms, such as online reviews, can increase the credibility of firms' quality statements in experience goods markets where other credible signals of quality are lacking, intensifying competition on quality. Using a dataset consisting of more than 12 million reviews from 40,000 U.S. hotels, we find that review platform penetration leads to economically meaningful quality improvements for independent hotels. These hotels lack other credible quality commitments such as repeat customers or external validation. We manage to resolve the major identification challenge of confounding contemporaneous changes in adoption of online reviews, competition intensity, and review valence norms. Identification is achieved by constructing realistic geographic markets that differ substantially from the platform's markets which are constrained by arbitrary political boundaries. The resulting differences in hotel exposure to the review platform pin down the effect of review platform penetration on hotel quality. The findings suggest that online reviews play an important role in facilitating competition on quality in addition to merely revealing quality in previously opaque markets.
